# Web Project Documentation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of various CSS selectors and JavaScript's `querySelector` method. It includes an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file that work together to showcase how different selectors can be applied to manipulate and style elements on a webpage.

## Project Structure
```
web-project
├── src
│   ├── index.html      # The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
│   ├── styles.css      # The CSS file that styles the HTML elements.
│   └── script.js       # The JavaScript file that demonstrates DOM manipulation using querySelector.
└── README.md           # This documentation file.
```

## Files Description

### `src/index.html`
This file contains the basic structure of the HTML document. It links to the external CSS and JavaScript files and includes elements that demonstrate various CSS selectors such as `first-child`, `nth-child`, and descendant selectors.

### `src/styles.css`
This file contains styles for the HTML elements, including styles for the `:hover` pseudo-class and specific styles for `div.list-item p` to illustrate how these selectors can be applied.

### `src/script.js`
This file contains JavaScript code that uses `querySelector` to select elements based on various CSS selectors. It demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM using selectors like `first-child`, `nth-child`, and others.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You can interact with the elements to see the effects of the CSS styles and JavaScript functionality.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical example of how to use CSS selectors and JavaScript to create dynamic and styled web pages. Feel free to modify the files and experiment with different selectors and styles!
